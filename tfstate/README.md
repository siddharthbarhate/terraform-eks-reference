Terraform module to create Remote State Storage resources for workload deployment on AWS Cloud.

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "backend" {
  source = "squareops/tfstate/aws"

  environment                                     = "Production"
  bucket_name                                     = "tfstate"
  force_destroy                                   = true
  versioning_enabled                              = true
  logging                                         = true
}

```

## IAM Permissions
The required IAM permissions to create resources from this module can be found [here](https://github.com/squareops/terraform-aws-tfstate/blob/main/IAM.md)

## Important Note
Terraform state locking is a mechanism used to prevent multiple users from simultaneously making changes to the same Terraform state, which could result in conflicts and data loss. A state lock is acquired and maintained by Terraform while it is making changes to the state, and other instances of Terraform are unable to make changes until the lock is released.

An Amazon S3 bucket and a DynamoDB table can be used as a remote backend to store and manage the Terraform state file, and also to implement state locking. The S3 bucket is used to store the state file, while the DynamoDB table is used to store the lock information, such as who acquired the lock and when. Terraform will check the lock state in the DynamoDB table before making changes to the state file in the S3 bucket, and will wait or retry if the lock is already acquired by another instance. This provides a centralized and durable mechanism for managing the Terraform state and ensuring that changes are made in a controlled and safe manner.
